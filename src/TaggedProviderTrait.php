/**
 * A Tagged Provider allows for routing based on a "tag method" of Events.
 *
 * This trait demonstrates and provides a way to map events to listeners based
 * on more than the Event type.  Specifically, it allows designation of a "tag method"
 * on an Event that returns a single string.  Listeners may be registered only on that
 * tag.  Examples here include form-instance-specific listeners (where the tag method
 * would return a form name or form ID), workflow steps (where the tag method returns a
 * workflow name or workflow step name), or any other case where the Event filter is
 * based on user-defined configuration.
 *
 * This trait does not handle registration, as that is explicitly left up to the implementer.
 * Provider classes using this trait need to fill in the eventType() and tagMethod() methods
 * (using whatever logic they choose, including passed in by constructor).
 *
 * @see ListenerProviderInterface
