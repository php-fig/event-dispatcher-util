 * A Delegating provider.
 *
 * The delegating provider allows for selected types of event to be handled by dedicated
 * sub-providers, which if used will block the use of a default sub-provider.  That is,
 * certain high-frequency event types can be handled by dedicated providers and then
 * skip the normal lookup process of the default provider.  That can provide a performance
 * benefit if certain tasks are triggered many dozens of times or more. It also allows
 * for dedicated providers for certain types of event that have runtime sub-types (such as
 * a form event that also cares about a form ID) without polluting other providers with
 * the extra matching logic.
 *
 * Note: The presence of a sub-provider that wants to intercept a given type of event
 * will be sufficient to block the default from firing, even if it has no applicable
 * listeners.
